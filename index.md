I am a research scientist with a multidisciplinary research background on machine learning, human-computer interaction, signal processing, and mathematical optimization. 

My research interests focus on developing techniques that combine state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and unobtrusive physiological signals to:

* decode human mental states
* understand human visual attention processes
* anticipate human decision mistakes

The final goal is to employ these techniques in real systems to improve human decision-making performance and solve human-machine interaction challenges.

I am a Research Associate at the Personal Robotics Lab (PRL), Imperial College London, UK. I am a Senior Research Officer on the project “Closed-Loop Multisensory Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhanced Decision Accuracy”. My main research interests focus on designing explainable machine learning algorithms to decode human mental states. The final goal is to use this information to improve human decision-making performance and to solve human-machine interaction challenges. In my research, I combine methodical experimental designs with principled deep learning architectures to achieve performance that can be analysed and explained.

I received my Ph.D. Degree in Electronic Engineering from University College London (UCL) in April 2017 with the Thesis topic: “Energy Efficient Large Scale Antenna Systems for 5G Communications and Beyond”. At UCL, my research focused on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless communication systems and signal processing techniques, with special emphasis on large-scale antenna array systems and algorithms for energy efficient communications.

Before being a Ph.D. candidate in the Electronic and Engineering Department at University College London, I held a JPL Visiting Student Researchers Program position in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Pasadena, CA (USA). At JPL, I worked on classification techniques for precipitation retrievals from radar data.

I received my M.Sc. degree with honours in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy, in 2013.

I am a Research Associate at the Personal Robotics Lab (PRL), Imperial College London, UK. I am part of the Senior Research Officer on the project “Closed-Loop Multisensory Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhanced Decision Accuracy”.

I received my Ph.D. Degree in Electronic Engineering from University College London (UCL) in April 2017 with the Thesis topic: “Energy Efficient Large Scale Antenna Systems for 5G Communications and Beyond”. At UCL, my research focused on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless communication systems and signal processing techniques, with special emphasis on large-scale antenna array systems and algorithms for energy efficient communications.

Before being a Ph.D. candidate in the Electronic and Engineering Department at University College London, I held a JPL Visiting Student Researchers Program position in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Pasadena, CA (USA). At JPL, I worked on classification techniques for precipitation retrievals from radar data.

I received my M.Sc. degree with honours in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Rome La Sapienza, Rome, Italy, in 2013.
